# HooBank  

Building a modern UX/UI for HooBank. Made with React and Tailwind CSS. In this project I learned the following: 
- React functional components and their reusability
- Tailwind CSS 
- React file and folder structure
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost all devices
